## Technical Notes

### Dependencies:
- Chart.js for charts
- Bootstrap 5 for UI components
- Thymeleaf for server-side templating

### Database:
- Uses existing Product table with buyer relationship
- No additional tables required for basic functionality

### Security:
- All endpoints require authentication
- Users can only view their own purchase history

## Testing

To test the implementation:
1. Start the application
2. Log in as a user
3. Navigate to Dashboard
4. Click "Buy History" card
5. Verify statistics and purchase history display
6. Test responsive design on different screen sizes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **No purchases showing**: Ensure user has bought products and they have a buyer relationship
2. **Chart not displaying**: Check if Chart.js is loaded and monthlyData is provided
3. **Styling issues**: Verify Bootstrap CSS is properly loaded

### Debug Tips:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify Thymeleaf variables are being passed correctly
3. Check database for proper buyer relationships on products

course.5.back.button=Back to course map
course.6.back.button=Back to course map
course.1.paragraph.1.title=What sustainability really means
course.1.paragraph.1.content=Sustainability is a simple but powerful idea: it means meeting our needs today ‚Äî such as food, energy, and shelter ‚Äî without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It's not just about the environment, but also about building an equitable and durable system for people and economy.
course.1.paragraph.1.pillars.title=The three pillars of sustainability:
course.1.paragraph.1.pillar.1=üåç Environment: Protecting nature and using resources responsibly.

course.1.paragraph.1.pillar.3=üí∞ Economy: Creating efficient, stable, and sustainable systems.

course.1.paragraph.2.myths.title=Some common myths:
course.1.paragraph.2.myth.1="Sustainability is only for environmentalists." ‚Üí False! Anyone can participate, regardless of age or profession.

course.1.paragraph.4.title=Why small actions matter

course.1.paragraph.4.stats.title=Powerful statistics:

course.1.paragraph.4.option.a=5
course.1.paragraph.4.option.b=30
course.1.paragraph.4.option.c=Over 300
course.1.paragraph.4.option.d=Just 1

course.1.paragraph.5.title=Keep things simple and consistent
course.1.paragraph.5.content=Living sustainably doesn't mean being perfect. The most important thing is to be consistent and curious ‚Äî to ask questions like "Where does this product come from?" and "What happens to it after I throw it away?". The more aware you are, the easier it will be to choose better.
course.1.paragraph.5.advice=Some people feel overwhelmed, but sustainability is a journey, not a checklist. Start with what feels accessible to you. Over time, you might get to composting, buying second-hand, or even supporting green policies.

# Course 3 - Paragraph 1

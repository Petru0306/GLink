course.3.back.button=Back to course map
course.4.back.button=Back to course map
course.5.back.button=Back to course map
course.6.back.button=Back to course map
course.1.paragraph.1.title=What sustainability really means
course.1.paragraph.1.content=Sustainability is a simple but powerful idea: it means meeting our needs today — such as food, energy, and shelter — without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It's not just about the environment, but also about building an equitable and durable system for people and economy.
course.1.paragraph.1.pillars.title=The three pillars of sustainability:
course.1.paragraph.1.pillar.1=🌍 Environment: Protecting nature and using resources responsibly.
course.1.paragraph.1.pillar.2=🏘️ Social: Ensuring safe, healthy, and equitable communities.
course.1.paragraph.1.pillar.3=💰 Economy: Creating efficient, stable, and sustainable systems.
course.1.paragraph.1.conclusion=When these three pillars are in balance, society can evolve in a way that supports both people and the planet. Sustainability doesn't mean giving up comfort — it means choosing smarter ways to live, produce, and consume.
course.1.paragraph.1.question=What are the three pillars of sustainability?
course.1.paragraph.1.option.a=Animals, forests, and oceans
course.1.paragraph.1.option.b=Environment, society, and economy
course.1.paragraph.1.option.c=Plastic, metal, and glass
course.1.paragraph.1.option.d=Money, jobs, and taxes

course.1.paragraph.2.title=Sustainability means more than recycling
course.1.paragraph.2.content=When people hear the word "sustainability," many think only of recycling or being vegetarian. But it's much more than that. Sustainability is a mindset — a way of thinking about how our choices affect the world and those around us, now and in the future.
course.1.paragraph.2.myths.title=Some common myths:
course.1.paragraph.2.myth.1="Sustainability is only for environmentalists." → False! Anyone can participate, regardless of age or profession.
course.1.paragraph.2.myth.2="I have to completely change my life." → False! Even small steps matter.
course.1.paragraph.2.myth.3="It's expensive to live sustainably." → Often false. Many changes actually save money, like turning off lights or avoiding food waste.
course.1.paragraph.2.conclusion=Understanding sustainability means seeing how everything is connected — the water you use, the clothes you wear, the food you consume. Our daily habits shape the world around us.
course.1.paragraph.2.question=Which statement is true?
course.1.paragraph.2.option.a=Sustainability refers only to nature
course.1.paragraph.2.option.b=You have to completely change your life to be sustainable
course.1.paragraph.2.option.c=Sustainability includes daily choices and an open mindset
course.1.paragraph.2.option.d=It's always more expensive to live sustainably

course.1.paragraph.3.title=How you can easily start being sustainable
course.1.paragraph.3.content=You don't have to wait or do something big to make an impact. You can start right now — from where you are. The secret is to focus on one small step at first.
course.1.paragraph.3.examples.title=Simple examples of sustainable actions:
course.1.paragraph.3.example.1=💡 Turn off lights when leaving a room
course.1.paragraph.3.example.2=🧴 Use a reusable bottle instead of a plastic one
course.1.paragraph.3.example.3=🚿 Take shorter showers to save water
course.1.paragraph.3.example.4=🚲 Walk, bike, or use public transportation
course.1.paragraph.3.example.5=🛍️ Refuse plastic bags and straws
course.1.paragraph.3.conclusion=Small actions, repeated daily, become powerful habits. The goal is not perfection, but progress. As you gain confidence, you'll discover new ways to help — and even inspire others.
course.1.paragraph.3.question=Which of the following is a sustainable action?
course.1.paragraph.3.option.a=Buying bottled water daily
course.1.paragraph.3.option.b=Using disposable utensils
course.1.paragraph.3.option.c=Riding a bike to school or work
course.1.paragraph.3.option.d=Leaving lights on all day

course.1.paragraph.4.title=Why small actions matter
course.1.paragraph.4.content=It's easy to think "What difference does it make if I recycle one bottle?" But every sustainable gesture adds up — and you're not alone. If millions of people reduce just one plastic item per day, we're talking about billions fewer reaching the oceans annually.
course.1.paragraph.4.stats.title=Powerful statistics:
course.1.paragraph.4.stat.1=A reusable bottle can replace over 300 plastic bottles in a year.
course.1.paragraph.4.stat.2=Turning off lights in an empty room can reduce energy waste by up to 20%.
course.1.paragraph.4.stat.3=Consuming local food can reduce transportation emissions by up to 90%.
course.1.paragraph.4.conclusion=Plus, your sustainable actions can inspire others — family, colleagues, neighbors. Your change can have a domino effect.
course.1.paragraph.4.question=How many plastic bottles can a reusable bottle replace in a year?
course.1.paragraph.4.option.a=5
course.1.paragraph.4.option.b=30
course.1.paragraph.4.option.c=Over 300
course.1.paragraph.4.option.d=Just 1

course.1.paragraph.5.title=Keep things simple and consistent
course.1.paragraph.5.content=Living sustainably doesn't mean being perfect. The most important thing is to be consistent and curious — to ask questions like "Where does this product come from?" and "What happens to it after I throw it away?". The more aware you are, the easier it will be to choose better.
course.1.paragraph.5.advice=Some people feel overwhelmed, but sustainability is a journey, not a checklist. Start with what feels accessible to you. Over time, you might get to composting, buying second-hand, or even supporting green policies.
course.1.paragraph.5.conclusion=Your first small step can lead to something big. What action are you willing to try this week?
course.1.paragraph.5.question=What mindset helps you live sustainably?
course.1.paragraph.5.option.a=Wait until you can be perfect
course.1.paragraph.5.option.b=Focus on one step and be curious
course.1.paragraph.5.option.c=Do what others do
course.1.paragraph.5.option.d=Only act if you're told to

# Course 2 - How to Recycle Correctly
course.2.title=How to recycle correctly
course.2.subtitle=Basic rules for recycling
course.2.paragraph.1.title=What is recycling and why it matters
course.2.paragraph.1.content=Recycling means transforming old or used materials — such as paper, plastic, and metal — into new products, instead of throwing them in the trash. It's one of the simplest and most efficient ways to reduce pollution, save natural resources, and prevent landfills from overflowing.
course.2.paragraph.1.benefits.title=When we recycle correctly:
course.2.paragraph.1.benefit.1=♻️ We save energy (e.g., recycling aluminum uses 95% less energy than producing it from scratch).

course.3.paragraph.5.habit.3=⏰ Use it at the same time each day to create the routine.
course.3.paragraph.5.habit.4=🎉 Celebrate small victories — every day you use the reusable object is a victory!
course.3.paragraph.5.conclusion=Once it becomes routine, you don't even have to think about it anymore. After a while, you'll notice that you want to make other changes: recycle better, buy less, choose local products. Sustainability starts with a small gesture and continues with big steps. All you need is to start.
course.3.paragraph.5.question=What helps you continue with sustainable changes?

# Course 4 - Paragraph 4
course.4.paragraph.4.title=What should NEVER be put in compost

course.6.paragraph.5.why.item.1=😊 Gives you immediate satisfaction — you see the clear result
course.6.paragraph.5.why.item.2=🏃 It's an active and healthy way to spend time
course.6.paragraph.5.why.item.3=🌍 You directly contribute to a cleaner, more beautiful world
course.6.paragraph.5.conclusion=No approvals or campaigns are needed. You just need 20 minutes, a garbage bag, and a positive attitude.
